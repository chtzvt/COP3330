4.34 In this statement, the error is the use of the ++ increment operator
on the expression (x + y), which is not valid. To properly print the sum of x and y,
one would use the following:
  System.out.println((x + y + 1));

5.8 A `break` statement will exit a loop completely, whereas a `continue` statement
will merely skip over the current iteration.

A `continue` statement might be useful if there is a condition in a loop where no
further processing is necessary, but where there may be in future iterations.

Conversely, a `break` statement would be used in a case where continuing over
further iterations would definitely not be needed.

5.9 The provided code would result in an infinite loop, as i will always satisfy
the condition of being greater than or equal to 1. This might be fixed by using
the decrement operator -- in place of ++.

Additionally, the capitalized 'For' should be substituted with the correct keyword
`for`.

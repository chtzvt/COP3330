Assignment 10

(Telephone-Number Word Generator) Standard telephone keypads contain the digits zero through nine.
The numbers two through nine each have three letters associated with them Fig. 1 below.
Many people find it difficult to memorize phone numbers, so they use the correspondence between digits and
letters to develop seven-letter words that correspond to their phone numbers.

For example, a person whose telephone number is 686-2377 might use the correspondence indicated in Fig.
1 to develop the seven-letter word “NUMBERS.” Every seven-letter word corresponds to exactly one seven-digit telephone number.
A restaurant wishing to increase its takeout business could surely do so with the number 825-3688 (i.e., “TAKEOUT”).

Every seven-letter phone number corresponds to many different seven-letter words, but most of these words
represent unrecognizable juxtapositions of letters. It’s possible, however, that the owner of a
barbershop would be pleased to know that the shop’s telephone number, 424-7288, corresponds to “HAIRCUT.”

A veterinarian with the phone number 738-2273 would be pleased to know that the number corresponds to the letters “PETCARE.”
An automotive dealership would be pleased to know that the dealership number, 639-2277, corresponds to “NEWCARS.”

Fig. 1 Telephone keypad digits and letters.

 

Write a program that, given a seven-digit number, uses a Formatter object to write
to a file every possible seven-letter word combination corresponding to that number.

There are 2,187 (37)(37) such combinations. Avoid phone numbers with the digits 0 and 1.

 
Use the PhoneTest.java to test your program.

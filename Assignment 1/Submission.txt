	c) Calculations are normally performed by ____________ statements.
	d) The arithmetic operators with the same precedence as multiplication are and_________.
	e) When parentheses in an arithmetic expression are nested, the ____________set of parentheses
	is evaluated first.

		d) Division, Modulo
		e) Innermost
		f) Variable

2.8

	Write Java statements that accomplish each of the following tasks:
	a) Display the message "Enter an integer: ", leaving the cursor on the same line.
	b) Assign the product of variables b and c to variable a.
	c) Use a comment to state that a program performs a sample payroll calculation.

	Answer:
		a)
			System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
		b)
			int a = b*c;
		c)
			// a program performs a sample payroll calculation

2.9

	State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
	a) Java operators are evaluated from left to right.
	b) The following are all valid variable names: _under_bar_, m928134, t5, j7, her_sales$,
	his_$account_total, a, b$, c, z and z2.
	c) A valid Java arithmetic expression with no parentheses is evaluated from left to right.
	d) The following are all invalid variable names: 3g, 87, 67h2, h22 and 2h.

	Answer:
		a) False- True for all other operators except for assignment operators, which are evaluated right to left
		b) True
		c) False- Java operators are evaluated in order of their precedence.
		d) True

2.10

	Assuming that x = 2 and y = 3, what does each of the following statements display?
	a) out.printf("x = %d%n", x);
	b) out.printf("Value of %d + %d is %d%n", x, x, (x + x));
	c) out.printf("x =");
	d) out.printf("%d = %d%n", (x + y), (y + x));

	Answer:
		a) x = 2
		b) Value of 2 + 2 is 4
		c) x =
		d) 5 = 5

2.11

	Which of the following Java statements contain variables whose values are modified?
	a) p = i + j + k + 7;
	b) out.println("variables whose values are modified");
	c) out.println("a = 5");
	d) value = input.nextInt();

	Answer: a, b, d


2.12

	Given that y = ax3 + 7, which of the following are correct Java statements for this equation?

	a) y = a * x * x * x + 7;
	b) y = a * x * x * (x + 7);
	c) y = (a * x) * x * (x + 7);
	d) y = (a * x) * x * x + 7;
	e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7;
	f) y = a * x * (x * x + 7);

	Answer: a, e

2.13

	State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following Java statements, and
	show the value of x after each statement is performed:

	a) x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1;
	b) x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2;
	c) x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3))));

	Answer:
		a) 15, Order: * / + -
		b) 3, Order: * / % + -
		c) 324, Order: Inner-outermost parentheses, *,/ +, *


2.25
	
	Write an application that reads an integer and determines and prints whether
	it’s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of 2. Any multiple
	of 2 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.]
		
	Answer:
		See attachment (EvenOdd.java)

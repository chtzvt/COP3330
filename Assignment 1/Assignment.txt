a) out.printf("x = %d%n", x);
b) out.printf("Value of %d + %d is %d%n", x, x, (x + x));
c) out.printf("x =");
d) out.printf("%d = %d%n", (x + y), (y + x));
 

2.11 [2 points] Which of the following Java statements contain variables whose values are modified?

b) out.println("variables whose values are modified");
c) out.println("a = 5");

2.12 [2 points] Given that y = ax3 + 7, which of the following are correct Java statements for this equation?

a) y = a * x * x * x + 7;
b) y = a * x * x * (x + 7);
c) y = (a * x) * x * (x + 7);
d) y = (a * x) * x * x + 7;
e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7;
f) y = a * x * (x * x + 7);
2.13 [2 points] State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following Java statements, and

show the value of x after each statement is performed:

a) x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1;
b) x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2;
c) x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3))));
2.25 [6 points] (Odd or Even) Write an application that reads an integer and determines and prints whether

it’s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of 2. Any multiple

of 2 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.]

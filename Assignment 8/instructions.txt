Assignment 8

Instruction to import a JAR file

[  A .jar is an archive file that contains multiple .java files.  You need to import it into your eclipse.

Instructions: In Eclipse click on the File Menu --> Import --> General --> Archive FILE.
First create a project before you import.
Or you may open it using a zip utility and drag & drop each file into an Eclipse project. ]


Download and import PayrollSystem.jar as a Java project into your Eclipse.
Modify this payroll system to include an additional Employee subclass PieceWorker that represents an
employee whose pay is based on the number of pieces of merchandise produced.

Class PieceWorker should contain private instance variables wage (to store the employee’s wage per piece)
and pieces (to store the number of pieces produced).

Provide a concrete implementation of method earnings in class PieceWorker that calculates the
employee’s earnings by multiplying the number of pieces produced
by the wage per piece.

Create an array of Employee variables to store references to objects of each
concrete class in the new Employee hierarchy.

For each Employee, display its String representation and earnings.

Note: You only need to submit one file, the PieceWorker class.
